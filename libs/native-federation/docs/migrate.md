# Migration Guide: Module Federation to Native Federation for Angular

## Motivation

Since Angular 17, the CLI ships with an esbuild-based builder that is remarkable faster than the original webpack-based solution. This new builder is used for newly generated projects and beginning with Angular 18 ng updates also migrates existing projects.

Native Federation for Angular is a thin wrapper around the esbuild builder that allows to use the proven mental model of Module Federation.

## Prerequisites

- Update your solution to the newest Angular and CLI version
- Update your solution to the newest version of `@angular-architects/module-federation` (!)
- Have a look to our [FAQs about sharing packages with Native Federation](share-faq.md)

In general, you need Native Federation for Angular 18.1 and Module Federation 18.x.

## Migration for Angular CLI projects

1. Remove Module Federation from your poject(s):

   ```
   ng g @angular-architects/module-federation:remove --project xyz
   ```

2. Update your workspace to the new esbuild-based build system:

   ```
   ng update @angular/cli --name use-application-builder
   ```

3. Initialize Native Federation for your projects:

   ```
   ng add @angular-architects/native-federation --project xyz --type remote --port 4201
   ```

   **Remarks:** Use type `remote` or type `dynamic-host`.

4. Adjust your `federation.config.js` generated for Native Federation. You can mostly copy over the settings from your `webpack.config.js` used for Module Federation before.

5. Update your EcmaScript imports in your source code. Make sure, you import from `@angular-architects/native-federation` instead of from `@angular-architects/module-federation`. Please also note that the signature of `loadRemoteModule` has been simplified:

   ```typescript
   // Before
   import { loadRemoteModule } from '@angular-architects/module-federation';

   [...]

   export const APP_ROUTES: Routes = [
       [...]
       {
       path: 'booking',
       loadChildren: () =>
           loadRemoteModule({
           type: 'module',
           remoteEntry: 'http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.js',
           exposedModule: './routes'
           })
           .then(m => m.MFE1_ROUTES)
       },
       [...]
   ];
   ```

   ```typescript
   // After
   import { loadRemoteModule } from '@angular-architects/native-federation';

   [...]

   export const APP_ROUTES: Routes = [
       [...]
       {
           path: 'flights',
           loadComponent: () => loadRemoteModule('mfe1', './Component')
               .then((m) => m.AppComponent),
       },
       [...]
   ];
   ```

   Please also note that loadRemoteModule now always points to a logical name that is resolved via the shell's federation manifest (`src/assets/federation.manifest.json` or `public/federation.manifest.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "mfe1": "http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.json"
   }
   ```

   Please also note that the remoteEntry is now a `.json` file.

6. If everything works, delete your `webpack.config.js`

## Migration for Nx projects

1. Remove Module Federation from your poject(s):

   ```
   nx g @angular-architects/module-federation:remove --project xyz
   ```

2. Initialize Native Federation for your projects:

   ```
   npm i @angular-architects/native-federation

   nx g @angular-architects/native-federation:init --project xyz --type remote --port 4201
   ```

   **Remarks:** Use type `remote` or type `dynamic-host`.

3. Adjust your `federation.config.js` generated for Native Federation. You can mostly copy over the settings from your `webpack.config.js` used for Module Federation before.

4. Update your EcmaScript imports in your source code. Make sure, you import from `@angular-architects/native-federation` instead of from `@angular-architects/module-federation`. Please also note that the signature of `loadRemoteModule` has been simplified:

   ```typescript
   // Before
   import { loadRemoteModule } from '@angular-architects/module-federation';

   [...]

   export const APP_ROUTES: Routes = [
       [...]
       {
       path: 'booking',
       loadChildren: () =>
           loadRemoteModule({
           type: 'module',
           remoteEntry: 'http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.js',
           exposedModule: './routes'
           })
           .then(m => m.MFE1_ROUTES)
       },
       [...]
   ];
   ```

   ```typescript
   // After
   import { loadRemoteModule } from '@angular-architects/native-federation';

   [...]

   export const APP_ROUTES: Routes = [
       [...]
       {
           path: 'flights',
           loadComponent: () => loadRemoteModule('mfe1', './Component')
               .then((m) => m.AppComponent),
       },
       [...]
   ];
   ```

     "mfe1": "http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.json"
   }
   ```

   Please also note that the remoteEntry is now a `.json` file.

5. If everything works, delete your `webpack.config.js`

## Module Federation Toolkit

For Module Federation, we offered a simple toolkit helping with Multi Version/ Multi Framework scenarios. However, this toolkit was quite simple and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. To give you more flexibility, instead of providing a respective package for Native Federation, [here](https://www.angulararchitects.io/blog/micro-frontends-with-modern-angular-part-2-multi-version-and-multi-framework-solutions-with-angular-elements-and-web-components/) we describe how to implement such a functionality by yourself.

## Issues

We have tested this guide with several projects. However, each project is different. If you run into issues, feel free to let us know.
